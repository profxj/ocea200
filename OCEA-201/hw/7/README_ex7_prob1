To compile the executable for question 1, type the following:

   make -f make.ex7 prob1

Before running the model you need to edit the input file prob1.input.

To run the model type:

  ./prob1.x

To plot the model output type the following:

  make -f make.ex7 plot1
  ./plot1.x

This is will create a postscript file called prob1.ps
which you can view using "gs" or "gv" or Adobe Acrobat Reader.

Each time you plot the new  model output, you need to rename the file prob1.ps
otherwise you will get an error.
